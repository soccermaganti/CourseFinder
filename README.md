# Project Description: Course Module Filtering System

This project aims to develop a filtering system for course modules, addressing the current limitations in course selection. The existing system lacks the ability to filter courses based on specific criteria, such as campus location, the semester (Fall/Spring) in which the courses are offered, the credit level (ranging from 3 to 7, indicating the course's difficulty and the typical stage at which students take it), and the number of credits each course awards. By implementing these filters, students will be able to efficiently narrow down their course options, ensuring they can select modules that align with their academic needs and preferences.


- Currently only works for specific course lists (could integrate an AI API for this?)
